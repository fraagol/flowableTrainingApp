# Flowable training project

This is a sample project to learn how to build a Spring Boot Flowable project step by step.

## Tasks to be performed

- Create REST endpoints to:
  - Get the list of available definitions (keys and names)
  - Start a new process by its key
  - Get the list of active tasks (task id, process id and task name)
  - Complete a specific task by task id
  - Get the image representing the current state of a process by process Id
- Either use a REST client (like [Postman] to interact with your API or create your own web application client interface)
